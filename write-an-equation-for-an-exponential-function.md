# Question 1

You are given the table of values below for an exponential function. Write an equation that models it.

| x | y |
| --- | ----------- |
| 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 4 |
| 2 | 16 |
| 3 | 64 |

The equation is y = 4<sup>x</sup>. 

The general form of an exponential function is y = ab<sup>x</sup>. So, you need to solve for a and b, and then substitute them into the equation.

Here, at x = 0, y = 1, so a = 1. To get b, notice that each y-value is multiplied by a factor of 4. 

An alternative way to get b is as follows. Using a = 1 from above, and given that the function is exponential, choose a point.
Let's choose (1,4). Plug the point (1,4) into the general form of an exponential equation.

<p></p>
Solving, you get b = 4.

# Question 2

The equation is 
<p></p>
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y = 8 \cdot {\frac{1}{4}}^x">

The general form of an exponential function is y = ab<sup>x</sup>. So, you need to solve for a and b, and then substitute them into the equation.

Here, at x = 0, y = 8, so a = 8. To get b, notice that each y-value is multiplied by 0.25 = 1/4. 

An alternative way to get b is as follows. Using a = 8 from above, and given that the function is exponential, choose a point.
Let's choose (1,2). Plug the point (1,2) into the general form of an exponential equation.

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y = a \cdot b^x">
<p></p>
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2 = 8 \cdot b^1">
<p></p>
Solving, you get b = 1/4.
