##### Answer: The equation is y = 4<sup>x</sup>. 

The general form of an exponential function is y = ab<sup>x</sup>. So, you need to solve for a and b, and then substitute them into the equation.

Here, at x = 0, y = 1, so a = 1. To get b, notice that each y-value is multiplied by a factor of 4. 

##### Alternative Explanation:

An alternative way to get b is as follows. Using a = 1 from above, and given that the function is exponential, choose a point.
Let's choose (1,4). Plug the point (1,4) into the general form of an exponential equation.

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=4 = 1 \cdot b^1">
<p></p>
Solving, you get b = 4.

##### Answer: The equation is: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y = 8 \cdot {\frac{1}{4}}^x">

The general form of an exponential function is y = ab<sup>x</sup>. So, you need to solve for a and b, and then substitute them into the equation.

Here, at x = 0, y = 8, so a = 8. To get b, notice that each y-value is multiplied by 0.25 = 1/4. 

##### Alternative Explanation:
An alternative way to get b is as follows. Using a = 8 from above, and given that the function is exponential, choose a point.
Let's choose (1,2). Plug the point (1,2) into the general form of an exponential equation.

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y = a \cdot b^x">
<p></p>
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2 = 8 \cdot b^1">
<p></p>
Solving, you get b = 1/4.

##### Answer: The equation is: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y = 2 \cdot {3}^x">

The general form of an exponential function is y = ab<sup>x</sup>. So, you need to solve for a and b, and then substitute them into the equation.

Here, at x = 0, y = 2, so a = 2. To get b, notice that each y-value is multiplied by 3. Hence, b = 3. 

##### Alternative Explanation:
An alternative way to get b is as follows. Using a = 2 from above, and given that the function is exponential, choose a point.
Let's choose (1,2). Plug the point (1,2) into the general form of an exponential equation.

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y = a \cdot b^x">
<p></p>
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2 = 2 \cdot b^1">
<p></p>
Solving, you get b = 3.

###### 4. You are given the table of values below for an exponential function. Write an equation that models it.

| x | y |
| --- | ----------- |
| 0 | 9 |
| 1 | 0 |
| 2 | 0 |

##### Answer: The equation is: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y = 9 \cdot {0}^x">

The general form of an exponential function is y = ab<sup>x</sup>. So, you need to solve for a and b, and then substitute them into the equation.

Here, at x = 0, y = 9, so a = 9. To get b, notice that each y-value is multiplied by 0, since y is 0. Hence, b = 0. 

##### Alternative Explanation:
An alternative way to get b is as follows. Using a = 9 from above, and given that the function is exponential, choose a point.
Let's choose (1,2). Plug the point (1,2) into the general form of an exponential equation.

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y = a \cdot b^x">
<p></p>
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2 = 9 \cdot b^1">
<p></p>
Solving, you get b = 0.

##### Answer: The equation is: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y = 7 \cdot {\frac{3}{2}}^x">

The general form of an exponential function is y = ab<sup>x</sup>. So, you need to solve for a and b, and then substitute them into the equation.

Here, at x = 0, y = 7, so a = 7. To get b, notice that each y-value is multiplied by 1.5, hence, b = 3/2. 

##### Alternative Explanation:
An alternative way to get b is as follows. Using a = 7 from above, and given that the function is exponential, choose a point.
Let's choose (1,2). Plug the point (1,2) into the general form of an exponential equation.

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y = a \cdot b^x">
<p></p>
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2 = 7 \cdot b^1">
<p></p>
Solving, you get b = 3/2.
