# Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

This project aims to provide a collection of questions for quick practice of exponential and logarithmic functions.  

Practice questions can be viewed in the browser by choosing from the list of topics linked below. 

To motivate users to work through the questions by themselves first, the answers are only revealed when clicked. 

To start practice, choose from the categories and topics below.

## Practicing Exponential Functions

| Topic      | 
| ----------- |
| [1. Recognize the exponential function](is-this-an-exponential-function.md)|
| [2. Write an equation for an exponential function](write-an-equation-for-an-exponential-function.md) 

## Practicing Logarithmic Functions

| Topic      | 
| ----------- |
| [1. Expand a logarithm](expand-logarithms.md) |
